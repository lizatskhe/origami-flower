# Animated Origami Flower

This project is a real-time animated origami folding simulation built with WebGL. It procedurally simulates the folding of a tulip using transformation matrices, manual fold logic, and per-vertex animation.

## Features

- Procedural mesh representation of a tulip

- Manual fold system with pivot points and rotation axes

- Smooth animation using time-based rotation

## Tech used

- Raw WebGL
- GLSL (shaders)
- JavaScript
